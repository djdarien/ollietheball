# Ollie The Ball

Game Description: "Adventures of Ollie The Ball: The Lost Coin Hunt" was inspired by Rolie Polie Olie. The game will be simple in nature but intuitive and fun at its core. The objective in game is simple collect all of Ollie's lost coins in each level.

This was the big game I worked on creating for several years learning Unity. I never really finished it.. however i was very playable and actual quiet fun!
